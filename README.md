✅ Project Title: Appy Fizz Homepage UI Clone
Time Period: April 2025

Project URL: [appy-fizz-home-page.vercel.app](https://appy-fizz-home-page.vercel.app/)

Associated With: Brototype – Brocamp

Description:
This was my fourth overall project and my first project after joining Brototype’s 7-month offline program (Brocamp) in Kozhikode Hub. I recreated the homepage of the Appy Fizz brand website using only HTML and CSS to practice layout building, navigation menus, and pixel-perfect styling.
Before developing, I studied layout techniques and responsive design basics on W3Schools. The entire build was done from scratch — no templates or frameworks — to strengthen my HTML/CSS foundation and attention to design detail. This project gave me hands-on experience in replicating real-world brand UI using clean structure and visual balance.

Tech Stack:

HTML

CSS

GitHub for version control

Deployed on Vercel

Key Highlights:

Real brand-inspired static website clone

Custom navbar and full-page banner structure

Strengthened layout and styling logic from scratch
